        "By the end of this session, you will be an expert in advanced agentic workflows:\n",

        "- **SequentialAgent**: You'll learn to chain agents together, creating pipelines where the output of one agent becomes the input for the next.\n",
        "\n",
        "- **LoopAgent**: You'll build iterative systems where agents can plan, critique, and refine their work until a specific goal is met, making them \"perfectionists.\"\n",

        "- **ParallelAgent**: You'll unleash efficiency by running multiple agents simultaneously and then synthesizing their collective findings into a single, comprehensive answer.\n",

            "text/markdown": "When it comes to the best sushi in Palo Alto, several establishments consistently receive high praise for their quality and experience.\n\nOne of the top recommendations is **Jin Sho**. It's frequently cited as a favorite for its fresh sushi, including highly praised otoro and creamy uni. Jin Sho is also noted for being the late Steve Jobs' favorite restaurant and offers great sushi, though portions can be small and prices expensive. They are known for exquisite Japanese cuisine and have chefs who previously worked at Nobu in New York. Jin Sho is located at 454 California Ave., Palo Alto.\n\nAnother highly regarded option is **Iki Omakase Palo Alto**, offering a modern and refined omakase experience from Chef Jb Li, who previously honed his skills at prestigious sushi establishments in San Francisco. They focus on using the finest globally and locally sourced ingredients.\n\n**Fuki Sushi** is a long-standing Palo Alto establishment often mentioned for its consistent high quality, warm atmosphere, and private seating. While some reviews suggest it might be slightly overrated by those less familiar with sushi, it's still considered a strong contender.\n\nFor a more upscale and inventive experience, **Sushi Roku - Palo Alto** at Stanford Shopping Center offers \"excellent service\" and \"delicious sushi\" with inventive rolls and appetizers, though it's on the pricier side.\n\n**Araki Sushi** on University Ave is praised for its authentic Japanese dining, masterful sushi craftsmanship, and fresh ingredients, offering a \"symphony of textures.\"\n\nHere's how to get to **Jin Sho** from the Caltrain station in Palo Alto:\n\n**Jin Sho** is located at 454 California Ave, Palo Alto, CA. The Caltrain station in Palo Alto is located at 95 University Ave, Palo Alto, CA.\n\n**Walking (approximately 15-20 minutes):**\n\n1.  From the Caltrain station, head southeast on University Ave toward El Camino Real.\n2.  Turn right onto El Camino Real.\n3.  Turn left onto California Ave. Jin Sho will be on your left.\n\n**Public Transportation (SamTrans Bus - approximately 10-15 minutes including wait time):**\n\n1.  From the Caltrain station, walk to the bus stop on University Ave @ Caltrain Station.\n2.  Take SamTrans bus route 22 (Southbound towards Menlo Park/San Jose Diridon) or 397 (Southbound towards San Jose Diridon).\n3.  Exit at California Ave & El Camino Real.\n4.  Walk a short distance down California Ave to reach Jin Sho.\n\n**Taxi/Rideshare (approximately 5-7 minutes):**\n\nA taxi or rideshare service would be the quickest option and readily available from the Caltrain station, dropping you directly at Jin Sho."

        "Sometimes a task isn't a straight line; it's a loop of refinement. A user might ask for a plan, but have constraints that require checking and re-planning. For this, the ADK provides the **`LoopAgent`**.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `LoopAgent` executes a sequence of sub-agents repeatedly until a condition is met. This is perfect for workflows involving trial and error, like planning a trip with a tight schedule.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Our New Workflow: The Perfectionist Planner**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Planner Agent**: Proposes an itinerary (e.g., a museum and a restaurant).\n",
        "2. **Critic Agent**: Checks the plan against a constraint (e.g., \"Is the travel time between these two places less than 30 minutes?\").\n",
        "3. **Refiner Agent**: If the critic finds a problem, this agent takes the feedback and creates a new, improved plan. If the critic is happy, it calls a special `exit_loop` tool to stop the process.\n",
        "\n",
        "The `LoopAgent` manages this cycle, ensuring we don't get stuck in an infinite loop by setting a `max_iterations` limit."
